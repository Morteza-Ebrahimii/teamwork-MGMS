            <h3>Health Benefits of Running and Jogging</h3>

            <p>While there is research that links faster running with greater health benefits (including a
                decreased
                risk for hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) the study authors are quick to point out
                that
                their results do not prove causality.3 That means faster running doesn't necessarily cause
                better
                health. Moroever, runners may sweat excessively and can be in need of added electrolytes.

                In fact, most health experts will tell you that the best exercise for optimal health is the
                exercise
                that you are willing to do on a regular basis. And in fact, many running coaches combine speed
                training
                (training at a faster pace) with days when your runs involve running for a long slow distance
                (LSDs).

                The bottom line is that when you decide to call yourself a runner is really a matter of personal
                preference. There's no pace test or threshold you need to pass to prove that you're a runner.
                And you
                don't need to run a race or wear special shoes to become a runner.

                If you've been jogging for years and you plan to keep jogging, then go right ahead and call it
                that. But
                if you love the sport (even if you dislike it sometimes), no matter your pace or level of
                experience,
                you can proudly call yourself a runner.</p>

            <h3>Jogging vs. Running</h3>

            <details>

                Jogging has no set definition, but is usually thought of as a slower form of running. While it
                may
                not quite be a full run, it is a different movement pattern and pace than walking. For most
                people,
                running includes moving at about 6 mph or about a 10-minute mile, which equal to about 30
                minutes to
                run
                5K. Below that pace, you are likely jogging. This is not set in stone, but rather a suggestion
                for
                how
                to gauge jogging vs. running.1

                If you run a 10-minute per mile pace, it will take you just over 30 minutes to complete a 5K
                race. A
                10K
                will take just over an hour and a marathon will take 4:22 to complete. According to some
                reports,
                the
                average running pace for a woman is 10:21 per mile and the average running pace for a man is
                9:03
                per
                mile.2

                But there really isn't any strict standard. It's not as if once you drop below a certain pace,
                you
                are
                suddenly defined as a jogger rather than a runner. In fact, most people run at various different
                paces
                depending on their distance, and most people slow down once they reach a certain age. So a
                distinction
                based on pace would be very confusing.

            <p>Swimming is a full-body, low-impact exercise, which is excellent for all body shapes and sizes. There are
                numerous benefits of swimming, including reducing stress, improving strength, and supporting heart
                health.</p>
            <h3>Low-Impact and Low-Risk</h3>
            <p>Swimming is a low-impact exercise, making it suitable for anyone with arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
                osteoporosis, or joint conditions. In addition, the soft resistance water provides makes it a safe
                workout.1

                A 2016 study found that swimming regularly helped people with osteoarthritis. Participants swam 45
                minutes a day, three times a week for three months. As a result, they saw an improvement in physical
                limitations and muscle strength. They even experienced a significant reduction in joint pain and
                stiffness.</p>

                Swimming is an excellent exercise for any body type, fitness level, and many medical conditions. If you
                have a disability or injury, swimming exercise can help ease the pain you're experiencing while
                providing a good workout.1

                Going for a swim is safe during pregnancy because you have a reduced risk of injuries. In addition, you
                can swim or do aqua exercises.3

                "Other cardio exercises that are high impact, such as running, actually can add up to four to five times
                your bodyweight on your hips and knees, when swimming elevates those issues," adds Dan Jonhenry,
                certified personal trainer and fitness coach at Retro Fitness.
